# Svelte 5 Shenanigans

Look i love svelte, maybe even too much. This project contains bunch of widgets made with svelte. Svelte 5 brought a lot of new features and improvements. I wanted to try them out and make some widgets with them.

## Widgets

- BMI Calculator
- Counter
- Todo List
- CRUD App
- Password Generator
- Temperature Converter

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:
3. Run `npm run dev`

## How to build

To Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with npm run preview.
